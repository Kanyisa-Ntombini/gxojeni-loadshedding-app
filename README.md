## EskomSePush API

### I've reached my limit!

- API users have a quota, and once this quota is used up in a period (typically daily), requests will be blocked until quota is available again
- Status & Area Information count for a single request
- Area Information has a ?test parameter; which does not count toward your quota. Use it for development!
- For free accounts: Areas Search, Areas Nearby & Topics Nearby count as 5 calls toward your request quota These don't need to be called automatically or often
- The Check Allowance can be called to check your quota used & remaining. This doesn't count against your quota.
