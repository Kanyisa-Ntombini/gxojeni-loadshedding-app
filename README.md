This project was inspired by my father. In December 2021 my father planted mielies in our family's land. A few weeks later hail rained down on our village destroying crops, houses and infrastructure. My village is a low income community and many farmers spent their limited resources on planting crops which was destroyed by weather related to Climate Change. I am trying to build a service that will provide farmers with weather data so that they can make informed decisions about when and how to plant crops.
